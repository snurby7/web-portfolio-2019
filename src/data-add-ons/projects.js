I remember just watching a talk and seeing people type "ccc" and it looked like they had just created an elegant block of code in a snap. This made me think, I write a lot of code on a good day, a lot of this code could be centralized, not just for myself but as a team. So it started as just creating karma tests, not all developers love testing, but this was to add a little bit of gas to their engine and get that to a point of ease. It's still not perfect, but it's better than it was. From write test snippets it bloomed into writing typescript snippets for things we all used regularly and some names were starting to get rather long, so snippets were my answer to that problem.`,
