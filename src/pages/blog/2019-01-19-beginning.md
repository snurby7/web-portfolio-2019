After paying Wix, for a year, I looked at it and realized:

> I DO THIS FOR A LIVING!

So shutting down my Wix account and moving it! So my hope is this will be the beginning of me expressing my thoughts onto a blog. Maybe I'll start throwing things on here
that I find around the web that I enjoy! Maybe I'll start mentioning some of the books I've been reading! Who knows! Stay
tuned for more!
