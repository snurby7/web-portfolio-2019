# Tap the boat

## The Story

A lot of things in life can be seen as a voyage, me writing this was a voyage. You want to go somewhere, you have to think about how you're going to get there.
You have to do a task, you break it down into parts. You get the point, it's a voyage. So why don't we treat life and business as a set of adjustments?
If you need to accomplish something you don't just make one sweeping motion and accomplish it, that's insanity and you'll regress back to the same port you wanted to leave.

Making small adjustments is human, it's how we go from point A to point B, we adjust, we adapt. Imagine if you will, going across the ocean in a boat.
You don't just wake up one morning and you're there, you sit down, look at a map, and plot a course, you plan for change, you adjust. Storms will come up, waves will crash,
land will be spotted, but the captain adjusts. If we look at life as the captain we'll succeed, but if we look at life as if there is no in between, the ship wrecks.

## Action

Think about life as an adjustment

- You hit a wall, you pivot
- You start taking on water, you find a bigger pail.
- You get stuck, you seek guidance

Make adjustments, life is a voyage!
